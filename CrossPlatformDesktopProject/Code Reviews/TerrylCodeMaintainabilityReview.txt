Specific comments on code quality
	What is readable: Every thing is very maintainable. I dont see anything that needs to be changed with the current
code until when/if it needs more code for future functionality. The code is reusable for things such as another player.
Maybe multiplayer.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	I think if we were to change the item class to not have a "Use" method it would probably break the "UseItem".
