Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	What is readable: Every thing is very readable. There are enough comments to indicate what is happening with the code.
The fields/method are uniquely named in order to under what that method/fields are doing.
Name conventations match the standards of c#. 
	What is not readable: Most of everything is readable. Although I would have like if a switch case was used in the update method
I probably would have also like if some of the code could be factored out. It looks like it may be doing two different things
that are similar but not as much. I think seperating the code for identifing the "Color" into another method would 
give the method high cohesion.
